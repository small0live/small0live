### Hi, I'm Olivia. 

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I primarily use this account for research projects and teaching materials. 

My research spans the social and computational sciences. I'm particularly interested in modeling human and technical aspects of collaboration in knowledge work domains that produce technological innovations. Currently, I work with my collaborators to understand and enhance teamwork and software in scientific computing.

Feel free to contact me (onewton at sigsoft dot org) about potential collaborations.
