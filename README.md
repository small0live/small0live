### Hi, I'm Olivia. 

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I primarily use this account for research projects and teaching materials. 

My research spans the social and computational sciences. I'm interested in modeling human and technical aspects of collaboration in knowledge work domains that produce technological innovations. Currently, I co-lead a project focused on examining and enhancing teamwork and software in scientific computing. I also contribute to research projects on team learning in scientific software development and use, psychological fidelity in simulation-based training, and expertise utilization in hybrid teams.

Feel free to contact me (onewton at sigsoft dot org) about potential collaborations.
