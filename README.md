### Hi, I'm Olivia. 

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I primarily use this account for independent and collaborative research projects, but you'll also find a couple of grad school projects here. 

My research spans cognitive, social, and computational sciences. I'm particularly interested in modeling human and technical aspects of collaboration in knowledge work domains that produce technological innovations. Currently, I work with my collaborators to understand and improve team-basesd scientific computing.

I also have a strong interest in ethics, epistemology, and systems theory in relation to computational research and development, which led me to complete extensive graduate coursework on these topics and also informed my dissertation research examining participation decisions and corporatization in free/libre and open source software project ecosystems. In this work, I aim to identify leverage points for increasing diversity in service of achieving greater equity and innovation in collective knowledge production. 

If any of the above topics are of interest to you, please feel free to contact me (onewton at sigsoft dot org) about potential collaborations and research ideas.
